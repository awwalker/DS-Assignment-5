Programming Project 5

Find Words Revisited

In this project you will revisit your project 2 implementation of a program that produces all possible words given a set of letters and a dictionary. Your program should produce all anagrams of all different lengths of a given set of letters that are valid words in the provided language dictionary. For example, if the letters are
recounts
your program should print, in alphabetical order and one per line, all different words that can be made out of those letters (assuming that they are present in the dictionary that the program uses):
construe
counters
recounts

The program that you write has to be command line based (no graphical interface). It should use the dictionary from a file provided as a command line argument and it should prompt the user for a set of letters. The output should be printed to the terminal. Once the anagrams are displayed, the program should terminate.
Your program should use the implementation provided with this assignment. You should make changes only to the Dictionary class and provide classes that are required by the Dictionary class.

## Objectives

The goal of this programming project is for you to master (or at least get practice on) the following tasks:

* using/modifying existing
* implementation of a generic binary search tree (or AVL tree)
* extending existing classes
* writing Java programs
